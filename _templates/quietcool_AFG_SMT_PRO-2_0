Pinout: 
- COM:  Ground, Tx, Rx, 3.3v

Optional, but highly recommended, rule to disable the fan from running during a fire @ 182F, which is a feature from the stock firmware.
```console
Backlog Rule 1 ON SHT3X#Temperature>182 DO Power0 0 ENDON; Rule1 1
```

There are physical buttons on the device that were used for the pairing and testing on the default firmware. You can configure them as
GPIO 27 to Button 1 and GPIO 26 to Button 2  but as this is a device that is living in an attic I didn't. 

The device also has a 3rd relay which isn't used in this model which would be used for a medium speed using GPIO22. 

There are 4 LED lights on the front of the device, The far left red power LED is tied to the power supply and not controllable.
There are 3 green led lights to the right of the Power LED that are comtrollable:
"Temp & Hum Timer" - GPIO 25
"Speed" - GPIO 33
"Bluetooth" - GPIO 32
